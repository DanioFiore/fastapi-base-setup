This module contains integration tests for 
    - API middleware features including CORS
    - logging
    - rate limiting
Functions:
    test_cors():
        Tests Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) functionality 
        by sending GET and OPTIONS requests with an Origin header.
        
        Verifies CORS headers such as Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Methods.
    test_logging():
        Tests the logging middleware by sending a GET request 
        and checking for X-Request-ID and X-Process-Time headers in the response.
    test_rate_limiting():
        Tests the rate limiting middleware by sending multiple requests to the API 
        and verifying that a 429 status code is returned when the rate limit is exceeded.

    Test CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) functionality of the API.

    This function performs two types of CORS tests:
    1. A simple cross-origin GET request with Origin header to verify CORS headers
    2. A preflight OPTIONS request to check allowed methods and CORS configuration

    The test simulates requests from 'http://localhost:3000' origin and validates:
    - Response status codes for both requests
    - Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in GET response
    - Access-Control-Allow-Methods header in OPTIONS response

    Prints test results including status codes and relevant CORS headers.
